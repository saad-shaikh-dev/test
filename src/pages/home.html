<h1>About</h1>
<p>
Saffron is one of the most precious spices in the world. The threadlike red stigmas—and the yellow hue they impart—are quite literally the stuff of legend. But what is saffron, exactly? No matter how many tales have been told about the spice, a lot of us still don't know what to do with it or whether its worth the high cost. Here's everything you need to know.
</p>
<p>
The spice originates from a flower called crocus sativus—commonly known as the "saffron crocus." It is believed that saffron originated and was first cultivated in Greece, but today the spice is primarily grown in Iran, Greece, Morocco, and India. While micro-scale production of saffron does exist in the United States, most saffron found here is imported.

Saffron is extremely subtle and fragrant. The slightly sweet, luxurious taste is totally enigmatic—it's tricky to describe but instantly recognizable in a dish. As annoying as it is to say, you know it when you taste it.
